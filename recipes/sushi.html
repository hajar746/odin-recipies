      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>1</span>
          Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Combine
          the rice and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high
          heat. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook for 18 minutes,
          then remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2</span>
          In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat
          over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let
          cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3</span>
          Spread the cooked rice over a large sheet of parchment paper, then
          sprinkle the vinegar mixture over the rice. Use a wooden spoon to mix
          the rice and vinegar together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4</span>
          Lay a sheet of nori on a flat surface, with the shiny side facing
          down. Wet your hands with water, then spread a thin layer of rice over
          the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top of the sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5</span>
          Lay a few strips of salmon, avocado, and cucumber over the rice, near
          the bottom edge of the sheet. Use your fingers to roll the edge of the
          nori up and over the filling, then continue rolling until the sushi is
          completely wrapped up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>6</span> Repeat with the remaining nori sheets and filling
          ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>7</span> Serve the sushi with soy sauce and wasabi on the side.
          Enjoy!
        </li>
        <p>Note: This recipe makes 4 rolls of sushi.</p>
