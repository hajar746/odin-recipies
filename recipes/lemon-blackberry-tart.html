      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>1</span>
          Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9-inch tart pan with a removable
          bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2</span>
          In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, powdered sugar, and salt.
          Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut in the butter until the
          mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3</span>
          Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared
          tart pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Set
          aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4</span>
          In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and
          lemon zest until well combined. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt
          and whisk until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5</span>
          Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake for 20-25 minutes, or
          until set and lightly golden brown. Let cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>6</span>
          In a small saucepan, heat the blackberry jam over low heat until
          melted. Brush the melted jam over the top of the cooled tart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>7</span>
          Arrange the fresh blackberries on top of the tart in a single layer.
          Serve immediately, or chill until ready to serve.
